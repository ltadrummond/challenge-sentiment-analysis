The aim of this project is to be able to analyse a sentiment of a tweet, being this positive or negative. To do so it's requeired to be able to do scrapping from tweets related to the famous netflix series Squida Game. Also it is needed to correclty clean and preprocess the tweets. 
Finally an sentiment analyser is deployed so anyone can analyse the sentiment on a desired tweet or get some general analytics about a tweet tag.
